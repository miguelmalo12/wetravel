## Introduction
WeTravel is a dynamic web application designed to assist users in discovering travel destinations that align with their unique preferences, as well as plan their trips. With an engaging interface to customize the itinerary and using AI for our personalized recommendation system, WeTravel aims to simplify the travel planning process, making simple, efficient and enjoyable for users.

## The App

### How It Works
- **User Signup**: Users can sign up and complete a questionnaire detailing their travel preferences, this will be saved in the database and will be used for all future recommendations.
- **Recommend Me**: Users can use this page to get a destination recommendation. Our algorithm uses AI and feeds it with the signup questionnaire data (immutable preferences) along with the inputs/filters on this page (mutable preferences), to generate a perfect destination match for the user.
- **Travel Planner**: On this page, users will find an intuitive and fun way of organizing their trips with all the events for each day. They can create new trips, easily access them and edit them.

### Branding and Design
- **User Interface**: All wireframes and designs were created on Figma before starting the project, and built from scratch, producing a unique UI that is innovative and doesn't resemble to any other existing app.
- **Color Scheme**: Utilizes blue and red to evoke feelings of the sea, sky, sun, and sand, enhancing the vacation vibe.
